
RSI-CB256 is a large scale remote sensing image classification benchmark via crowdsource data. 
can be downloaded from https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=010149152ff2b56d&id=10149152FF2B56D%21105&authkey=!ADyXDc-zA56zPv4

splitting dataset.ipynb used to split the dataset 
RSI-CB256 into training, validation and test set.

satellite-data_splitted folder-dataset has the 3 folders with the splitted data train, val, test

Seperate folders are made for each model each has 3 files- the path for respective dataset has to be given in each code notebook file
1. A modelname.ipynb training file (requires to load train and val dataset from splitted dataset folder)
2. A saved mode.h5 file 
3. A modelname_performance.ipynb file which loads the model.h5 file and tests the performance on test data.(requires to load test dataset from splitted dataset folder
